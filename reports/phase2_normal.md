	What is “normal CPU behavior” for this machine?
     - normally cpu have bursts but the overall usage is low
     - cpus are made for this fluctuations
     - the overall cpu usaage is 38%
     - fluctuation does not equall = dangorus 
     - high variance is expected

    What is “normal memory behavior”? 
     - noraml memory should be stable 
     - varian should be low 
     - the usage of memery should not we at celing 
     - which is in outcase memory stays at 90-95 with varian of 11 
     - stability does not euqall to safe 

    Which deviations are acceptable?
    - Mean ≠ danger
    - Change in behavior = danger 

    Which deviations are risky?
     - memory stays in celing which might fail the system and not safe

    Why averages alone are insufficient
     - avg does not include changes the bigger the variance, the bigger the risk
