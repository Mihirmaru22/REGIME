	1.	Which deviation signal is most informative? Why?
     - memory var deviation signal was most informative as most of the time it stayed flat but around 580k was a spike

	2.	Which deviation signal is mostly noise? Why?
    - cpu mean dev was mostly noise as the cpu have spike with lows and highs not unusall changes
	3.	Identify one time window of sustained change.
     - around 580k so we can say 575k to 585k is the window

	4.	Explain why this would be missed by average-based monitoring
    - the changes are not unsually for avg based it's possbible normal but hight variance can fail sysem withought warning
